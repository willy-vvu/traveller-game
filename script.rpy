"Preparations to leave the planet move slowly."
"We can’t move too many people to the ark at once - it would attract too much attention."
"So we gather food and supplies and look for stragglers."
"I know these hills better than any of the others, so I lead the search parties."

"Penelope is loud. She keeps me awake at night, crying and whining."
"The search parties are calmer than staying at camp with her."

"But she misses me when I'm gone. She looks at me sometimes, makes noises, tugs at my fingers."
"Just when I feel myself collapsing from exhaustion, she touches my nose and gurgles and I'm jolted awake with love for her."

"I am enjoying a moment of quiet, reading over supply lists in the corner of our tiny room, when I hear something rustling on the floor."
scene bg first-steps
"She is on her feet, wobbling and teetering with the effort. Tentatively, she takes a step."

"And another."

"She walks to me."

"The remaining supplies are dwindling. We will have to choose whether to feed everyone here or stock up the ark."

"But I don't care."

"The supply lists flutter to the floor as I take her up in my arms."

"She is smiling, giggling, confident."
scene bg earth-night
"Her first words are more like a grumble, but then they come out all at once in a matter of weeks, and before I know it she is babbling non-stop."

"I start to take her to meetings. She babbles through them as we discuss strategy."

"We have to move our west-side camps. The enemy is too close to them, and if we are discovered the whole operation would be compromised."

"I will lead the relocation."
"We will have to move through the hills."
"Even if we pass unnoticed, the road is long, steep and dangerous."
"Some of our people will die - the elderly, the sick, maybe some of the children."

"I hug Penelope more tightly than I ever have, and leave her with the commander."

"When I return, she calls me mom."
scene bg earth-day
"Penelope has names for things now."
"She wants to know what everything is called, why it is the way it is, how it works."
"She asks these questions of me but also of the others."
"She asks them until they get angry and I have to apologize on her behalf."

"I take her for as many walks as I can, but the preparations are almost complete."
"I have to attend to them. I leave her alone more than I'd like."

"She comes up with her own names for things while I'm gone."
"When I come back after a hard day to find that - in a complete coincidence - she has decided to call 'bees' 'cees', I find myself laughing so hard that my sides hurt."
"She starts crying. She likes her name better. Why can't we just change it?"
scene bg earth-night
"She loves when the kitchen serves stew."
"She likes to pick herbs from the garden and cover her portion in them until her bowl tastes overwhelmingly of coriander."
"She cries when we run out of coriander and I can't find any more."

"I don't want to tell her that she will never eat it again."

"We are on a walk picking flowers when explosions light up the horizon, followed by clouds of black smoke."

"I pick her up and run back to the base."

"She stuffs it full with the flowers from our walk."
"Then she looks at me, her eyes puffy with tears."
"I freeze in that look. All I want to do is make her happy again."

"The alarm sounds through the hallways. I can’t hear anything beyond it. I snap back to the present."

"Regulations. We have to follow the rules."
"Some of the refugees are allergic to pollen, and if too much of it were to get into the air vents--"

"I take the flowers out of the bag and scatter them on the bed."
"She cries harder, grabs them, grabs onto the sheets and then the mattress."
"She is screaming now. She won't leave."

"The alarm sounds again. We have to go."

"I take her by the waist and pull as hard as I can."
"I pull her fingers from the mattress."
"She holds on with one hand and so I drag her out the door until she can't fit the mattress and she has to let go."
"She shrieks into my ear."
"She doesn't want to leave, she doesn't want to leave, she won't leave."

"I see her blanket sprawled on the floor."
"It has little cats on it, prancing around and playing with balls of yarn."
"She's never met a cat, but she imagines that all the cats on this blanket are hers, and tosses it around to get them to play with her."
"It's probably covered in snot and drool and who knows what by now, but she cuddles up to it every night."
"I rarely have the chance to wash it because she won't sleep without it."

"The alarm sounds again. She is fighting me now."

"I hold her tightly and run for the exit."

"The doors close a few minutes after we make it in."

"The commander worries about the enemy forces."
"We are making ourselves a target as long as we idle here. We can't sacrifice ourselves for a few stragglers."

"She is right. But I look around."
"Fewer than half of us made it."
"The ark's halls are practically empty."
"Those who remain are crying, gasping, searching for families who didn't make it in."

"Penelope has stopped fighting in my arms. I get to a chair and buckle her in with me."

"The ark comes to life with a rumble that feels like an earthquake."
scene bg leaving-earth
"We watch our home get smaller and smaller out the window."
"We see cities blackened by bombs."
"We see black specks on white fields and I know they are labour camps."
"We see smoke. Ships. Debris."
"Then we are above the clouds."
"The sky gets darker as we ascend deeper into it."
"Distantly, beyond the clouds, we see a smouldering patch of red and orange."
"Some huge tract of land, set ablaze. It must be the size of a small country."

scene bg space

"The Earth is distant now. It's about the size of an apple in the window."

"We don’t notice the long nights, either."
"I say it’s been nine months since we left Earth, but it only feels that way."
"Actually, to conserve resources, every night when we fall asleep in our pods, the station puts us into stasis."
"We haven’t figured out how to keep a person in stasis successfully for too long, so each ‘night’ lasts approximately three weeks..."

"The bridge is dome-shaped, the entire ceiling made of glass."
"The screens on the glass depict the constellations and our rough location among them."
"Towards the ground, they cycle through text, graphs and charts showing our velocity, resources, and nearby star systems."
"The seats normally all face inward towards the center, but right now the bridge crew are focused on their own screens."
"It's a little like a planetarium - and just as dark. Penelope clutches my leg. She's still scared of it."
"I had them bring a couch in here when we came aboard, and this is where I put her, with the promise I won't take long."
"She's nervous at first, but when I set up a game to play on one of the screens while I'm gone, she settles down."

"It seats one, with barely enough room to stretch out your arms. The first time I flew it, I felt so claustrophobic I had trouble focusing."
"Now, after so long in the emptiness of the ark, it's almost comforting."
"I sit down in the cockpit and close the hatch above me."
"When it's closed, the hatch forms a clear glass dome - almost a miniature of the bridge."
"I press my fingertips on the controllers on the arms of the chair and the screens lining the dome come to life."
"I check the energy levels, shields, the stasis pod. All in working order."
"I open the map. The tiny red dot is the ark; the yellow one, smaller and flashing, is me."
"I turn on the antimatter engine. It makes a low hum - I can almost feel the buzzing in my seat."
"The hangar door opens. I turn on the radio."
sol "Have a safe trip."
t "I'll try. Don't have too much fun without me."
"I push forward with my fingertips. The ship buzzes again, and with a jolt the shuttle pushes out into space."
"I look at the windows as I fly past the ark. A few people have lined up to watch me go."
"I wonder where Penelope is among them."
"I think I see a smaller shadow among the group -"
"...but the shuttle finds its course and accelerates."
"The ark fades into the vacuum of space."
"I turn my attention to the screens. Everything looks stable."
"The shuttle has plotted a course, and the autopilot is working properly."
"I could go into stasis now, but I play Penelope's game for a couple of hours first."
"I still can't beat that boss."
"More exhausted than frustrated, I give up and look out at the stars for a while."
"They're so bright that it's almost dizzying."
"I really haven't seen this many stars in my life."
"I make one last check - all systems running smoothly - and turn on the stasis pod."
"The chair reclines backward until it lies flat. The control panel on the armrest opens up; I slip my arms inside of it and it closes around them."
"I feel a sting in my wrists - the needles going in. But before I really feel it, my body starts to relax."
"I try to stare up out the window a moment longer, but sleep takes me before I realized that my eyes are already closed."

"Strange-smelling sludge from the ocean floor, something that resembles an eel cooked on engine fuel from a derelict ship, fungi that taste saccharine sweet."
"I worry about local bacteria, but the creature uses old alien devices to scan my body and feeds me little bits of things to test my reactions."

"As I bring them back to the cave, it occurs to me that I should have no idea whether these things are even edible for the family... but they are. I'm certain they are. And sure enough, as soon as I return, the father reaches for my bag and empties the contents into a large pot of water he has boiling over a fire in the corner of the cave."

"I lurch forward and grab my knees and heave my shoulders to support the cries, to contain them, to reduce their effects - but they keep coming."
"The cave is filled with his piercing whistle and my choked gurgling. The sounds don't harmonize, but the rhythm of my crying aligns with the shudders in his notes, and soon we're shuddering in tandem across the cave."
